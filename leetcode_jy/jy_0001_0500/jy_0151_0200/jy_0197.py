Table: Weather
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| recordDate    | date    |
| temperature   | int     |
+---------------+---------+
id is the column with unique values for this table.
This table contains information about the temperature on a certain day.
 

Write a solution to find all dates' Id with higher temperatures compared to its previous dates (yesterday).

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:
Input: 
Weather table:
+----+------------+-------------+
| id | recordDate | temperature |
+----+------------+-------------+
| 1  | 2015-01-01 | 10          |
| 2  | 2015-01-02 | 25          |
| 3  | 2015-01-03 | 20          |
| 4  | 2015-01-04 | 30          |
+----+------------+-------------+
Output: 
+----+
| id |
+----+
| 2  |
| 4  |
+----+
Explanation: 
In 2015-01-02, the temperature was higher than the previous day (10 -> 25).
In 2015-01-04, the temperature was higher than the previous day (20 -> 30).

# 解法 1
select a.ID, a.date
from weather as a cross join weather as b 
     on datediff(a.date, b.date) = 1
where a.temp > b.temp;


# 解法 2
select a.ID, a.date
from weather as a cross join weather as b 
     on timestampdiff(day, a.date, b.date) = -1
where a.temp > b.temp;
